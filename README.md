# Fingerprint-Position-Prediction-using-KNN-model

The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. It loads a dataset, checks for missing values, and replaces them with the mean. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is created and trained. Predictions are made on the test set, and the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix. Lastly, it tests different values of K to find the optimal number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm.

## Section 1: Import Necessary Libraries
This section imports the required libraries to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks:
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **sklearn** for model building, specifically using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification**.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization.
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
