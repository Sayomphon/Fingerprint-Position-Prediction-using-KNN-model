# Fingerprint-Position-Prediction-using-KNN-model

The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. It loads a dataset, checks for missing values, and replaces them with the mean. The data is then split into training and testing sets, and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model is created and trained. Predictions are made on the test set, and the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix. Lastly, it tests different values of K to find the optimal number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm.

## Section 1: Import Necessary Libraries
This section imports the required libraries to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks:
- pandas and numpy for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- sklearn for model building, specifically using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification.
- matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
